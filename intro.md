Introduction of Rem Language
--------------------------------

Rem language is currently implemented by Python, which is for people who're working on the fields of Python, Julia, R or MATLAB .etc...

All in all, Rem has a lot of features to support programming comfortably.

I'm planning to write a C# backend for Rem sooner in order to get rid of too much Python(however we shouldn't ignore the requirements of works in real world), and comfortable compilers will come up, too.
